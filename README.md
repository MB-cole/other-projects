These projects were created outside of school in my own time, purely out of personal interest.
My goal is to build a reference "library" that I can use whenever I get stuck on or forget minor things in the future(think like basic loops or syntax).
This way, I don't need to look up basic things...something that I feel weakens my growth as a developer and stunts my thinking.

Feel free to explore! If you notice anything that could be improved, Iâ€™d greatly appreciate your feedback.
